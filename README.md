# DSSIM Analysis
ImageJ, Matlab, and Python code for applying DSSIM analysis, as described in the 2023 Ultramicroscpy publication: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2023.113894

Highlights:
- Structural dissimilarity analysis provides structural dynamics maps from videos.
- Structural dissimilarity analysis is segmentation-free analysis method but provides comparable results to segmentation analysis.
- Structural dissimilarity analysis is simple and computationally efficient.

## How to tweak this project for your own uses

For small dataset (<200 MB) we reccomend testing with the ImageJ pugin. For larger datasets (1-100 GB) that benefit from more effiecent code, we recommend using the Matlab script or Python Jyputer notebook.

## Find a bug?

If you found an issue or would like to submit an improvement to this project, please email mulveyj@uci.edu

## Known issues (Work in progress)

These programs are currently extremely RAM intensive, and were designed for workstations with 100+ GB of RAM.  Min 32 GB RAM is recommended.
