# DSSIM Analysis MATLAB Code

## How to run the example

"dssim_analysis.m" is a standalone function file, and "dssim_analysis_example_script.m" is an example for applying the analysis to "Traffic_example_for_DSSIM.avi". Download all files to the same folder and run the example script, which will write 3 output files. We recommend modifying the example script to run with your data and analysis parameters.

## How to tweak this project for your own uses

We recommend working and modifying the example file for your own data and analysis.
